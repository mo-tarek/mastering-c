**What is data structure?**
--
Data Structure is the way of Storing and access data from memory so that data can be used effeciently.

Actually in our programming data stored in main memory and to develop efficient software or firmware we need to care about memory.

To effciently manage data we need data structure.


Types of data
- Primitive data
  - Integer
  - Float
  - Character
  - Boolean
- Non-primitive data
  - Linear data structure
      - Arrays
      - Linked list
      - Stack
      - Queue
  - Non-linear data structure
      - Trees
      - Graphs


Linear data structure:
        A data structure is said to be linear if items are arranged        in linear or squential format.


The foundation terms of a data structure
--
- **Interface:** Each data structure has an interface. Interface represents the set of operations that a data structure supports. An interface only provides the list of `supported operations`, `type of parameters` they can accept and `return` type of these operations.

- **Implementation:** Implementation provides the internal representation of a data structure.
